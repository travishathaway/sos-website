## Abstract

Car powered mobility systems have become an integral part of every
major city around the world. As cities have grown, so too has the interconnected
web of roads, streets, bridges and freeways that support this system.
With these systems, also comes many negative side-effects that cities are
struggling to deal with, which include increasing levels of traffic, CO2 emissions
and safety concerns. The city of Kiel in Germany is currently in the
process of re-imagining its transportation system to be one that relies less
on cars and more on alternative forms such as walking, bicycling and public
transit. This thesis aims to contribute to this ongoing process by developing
a novel method for assessing walkability within the city. Adding this dimension
into future analysis can help provide stronger arguments for the types
of car reduction strategies which are also covered in this thesis. Also examined
will be the correlations between walkability and mobility preference by
comparing walkability with recent results from a survey conducted in Kiel.
